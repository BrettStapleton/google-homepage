This project is all about my learning experience on front-end web development so far.
I will continuously add to this what I have learned as I follow along on The Odin Project.
You can see the course I'm following from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
